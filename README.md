## What is Lunar Client ?
Lunar Client is a PvP Client for 1.8.9 Minecraft which is very popular and makes gameplay much more enjoyable for PvP in 1.8.9

Lunar Client needs a premium Minecraft account to be used and does not work without it but this crack made by PrimeTDMomega (thats me) that does not require a premium Minecraft account and can be used in launchers such as TLauncher or even the Official Minecraft Launcher.
